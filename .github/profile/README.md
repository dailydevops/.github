# Daily DevOps & .NET

Welcome to our GitHub profile! We are a bunch of developers who love to share our knowledge and experience with the community. As part of our daily requirements, we create and maintain NuGet packages, mostly building blocks for .NET applications.

## Overview - NuGet Packages

We try to keep our packages as simple as possible, focusing on a single task or a small set of related tasks. This way, you can easily integrate them into your projects as accelerators or building blocks.
